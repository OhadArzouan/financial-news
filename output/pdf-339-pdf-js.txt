(hh)   Upselling   means   soliciting   the purchase   of   goods   or   services following an   initial   transaction   during   a single telephone   call.

An "external   upsell"   is   a   solicitation made   by   or   on   behalf   of   a   seller   dif- ferent   from   the   seller   in   the   initial transaction,   regardless   of   whether   the initial   transaction   and   the   subsequent solicitation   are   made   by   the   same   tele- marketer.   An   "internal   upsell"   is   a so- licitation   made   by   or   on   behalf   of   the same   seller   as   in   the   initial   trans- action,   regardless   of   whether   the   ini- tial   transaction   and   subsequent   solici- tation   are   made   by   the   same   tele- marketer.
