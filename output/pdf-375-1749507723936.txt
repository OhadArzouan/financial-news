BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM WASHINGTON, 0. C. 20551 JEROME H. POWELL CHAIR June 6, 2025 Dear Sir or Madam: I wish you and your family well. I am writing to ask you to participate in the Federal Reserve’s 2025 Census of Finance Companies and Other Lenders. The results of this census, which is conducted every five years, form the basis of our statistical releases and will contribute to better-informed policy decisions. Your participation is important for helping us understand the size and structure of companies that supply credit or lease financing to U.S. households and businesses. Your response is considered confidential and will be treated accordingly. You can participate in one of three ways: complete the survey online; fill out an electronic PDF version of this form; or fill out this form and return it in the postage-paid envelope. (You can access the first two options at www.federalreserve.gov/financecocensus.) Participation is voluntary, but we very much hope you will take part in this important effort to ensure an accurate portrait of the finance company industry. If you believe you have received this request in error—for example, if your company does not provide credit or lease financing—it is still important that you let us know of that fact by completing the questionnaire. I encourage you to visit our FAQ page, available at www.federalreserve.gov/financecocensus/faq.htm, for more information about this effort. If you still have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us by e-mail at Finance-Census@frb.gov or by phone at (800) 281-4930. To help us serve you better, please reference in all correspondence your Unique Company ID printed above. Thank you for your assistance. Sincerely,
