- 2 - About the Shared National Credit Program The Shared National Credit (SNC) Program assesses risk in the largest and most complex credit facilitie s shared by regulated financial institutions (bank s ) and nonbank investors (nonbanks) . The SNC Program is governed by an interagency agreement among the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the agencies). The program began in 1977 to review borrowers w ith minimum aggregate loan commitments totaling $20 million or more that were shared by two or more regulated financial institutions (banks). A program modification in 1998 increased the minimum number of regulated financial institutions from two to three. To adjust for inflation and changes in average loan size, the agencies increased the minimum aggregate loan commitment threshold from $20 million to $100 mil lion effective January 1, 2018. SNC reviews are completed in the first and third quarters of the calendar year. Large agent banks receive two reviews each year while other agent banks are reviewed less frequently. The results discussed in this document reflect reviews conducted in the first and third quarters of 202 4 , and primarily cover loan commitments origi nated on or before June 30, 202 4 . Trends and exhibits shown in the report include outstanding loans and commitments by all reporting banks. Although some banks are reviewed twice a year, the agencies issue a single statement annually that captures combined findings from the previous 12 months. The next statement will be released upon comp letion of the third quarter 202 5 SNC review. Summary of Results Overall , SNC c redit risk remains moderate . There was a modest increase in the severity of risk due to a migration of commitments from s pecial mention to a classified rating. T he trend reflect s the continued pressure of higher interest rates , which have increased significantly since early 2022, and the impact of compressed operating margins in some industry sectors. C ommitments rated special mention and classified (non - pass ) have increased slightly from 8.9 percent of t otal commitments in 202 3 to 9 .1 percent in 202 4 . U.S. and foreign banks continue to own the largest share of SNC commitments , while n onbanks hold the largest share of special mention and classified loans . Nonbank holdings are concentrated in non - investment grade 1 term loans identified and reported as leveraged by agent banks . The agencies continue to select SNC transactions to review using a risk - based sampling approach, which in 202 4 focused on bank - identified leveraged loans, special mention and classified loans, and loans to borrowers in stressed industr y segments (202 4 Focus Industries as defined on page 6 ). Asset quality measures and trends in the composition of SNC commitments by major industry group 2 are provided in A ppendix C. The modestly higher rate of special mention and classified commitments in 202 4 is driven by weakened credit quality in T echnology, T elecom, and M edia ; Commercial Services; H ealth C are and P harmaceutical ; and Materials and Commodities excluding Oil and Gas industry segments. Technology, Telecom and Media comprise one - third of the total s pecial m ention and classified commitments. While the overall level of special mention and classified commitments in the Commercial R eal E state sector remain s slightly below the portfolio average, the o ffice sub - sector continues to show a decline in credit quality with above portfolio average special mention and classified volumes . 1 In this document, t he terms "non - investment grade" and "investment grade" are based on bank - provided facility - level equivalent ratings . 2 The agencies introduced industry data in 2008 that presented industries vertically along product origination and distribution lines. T he review places borrowers in seven primary sectors, largely following the outline of the 2017 U.S. Census Bureau North American Industry Classification System codes (see appendix C).

- 3 - The magnitude and direction of risk in 202 5 is likely to be impacted by borrowers’ ability to manag e interest expense , real estate conditions , and other macroeconomic factors. T hese elements will continue to impact the financial performance and repayment capacity of borrowers in a wide variety of industries , especiall y highly leveraged borrowers that may lack the financial flexibility to respond to external challenges . Leveraged Loans C redit risk associated with leveraged lending remains high. While l everaged loans comprise nearly half of total SNC commitments , they represent a disproportionately high percent of the total special mention and classified exposures. SNC reviews continue to note that many leveraged loans contain weak structures. These structures often reflect layered risks that include some combination of high leverage levels , aggressive repayment assumptions, and other underwriting weaknesses . Business models that focus on distribution of widely syndicated institutional term loans to nonbanks tend to produce higher levels of marginal structure s. Investor demand for loans has enabled borrowers to obtain less restrictive terms, which continues to result in a high volume of layered risk. T o date, t he performance of these leverage d loans ha s not been tested through a typ i cal economic cycle. The agencies continue to focus on assessing the impact of layered risks in leveraged lending transactions and the appropriateness of credit risk management practices in adapting to the changing environment. Banks appropriately manage leveraged lending exposure by employ ing risk management practices that adhere to regulatory safety and soundness standards and adapt to changing economic conditions. Nonbank entities continue to participate in the leveraged lending market to earn returns by holding purchased credit exposure. These nonbank entities hold a significant portion of non - pass leveraged commitments and non - investment grade 3 equivalent leveraged term loans. By comparison, the SNC leveraged exposure held at banks is primarily comprised of investment grade equivalent revolving credit facilities. However, the agenci es note that these investment preferences are not universal as risk appetite varies among bank and nonbank participants . S NC Commitments: Volume, Credit Quality, and Trends Overall SNC Population The 202 4 SNC commitments totaled $ 6. 5 trillio n . T otal commitments showed a modest increase of $ 113 billion, or 1 . 8 percent year - over - year , with an increase of $ 98 billion in loans reported as investment grade by agent bank s . O utstanding balances remained virtually unchanged with an increase of 0 . 2 percent over the same timeframe. Additionally, t he number of borrowers and credit facil ities increased by 1.7 and 1.3 percent, respectively in 202 4 (see exhibit s 1 and 2 ). 3 In this document, t he terms "non - investment grade" and "investment grade" are based on bank - provided facility - level equivalent ratings.

- 4 - Exhibit 1: Overall Credit Facilities and Commitment Trends Note: The decline in the number of SNC credit facilities between 2017 and 2018 mainly reflects the minimum commitment increase from $20 million to $100 million . Exhibit 2 details the year - over - year changes in aggregate SNC commitment amounts and reflects a modest increase in total special mention and classified commitments and a migration in the level of special me ntion (referred to as “SM” in the table below) to classified SNC commitm ents . In addition, the volume of nonaccrual commitments increased by 29.1 percent , driven by commitments within the Technology, Telecom and Media industry. Exhibit 2: SNC Summary Statistics Total Commitments $6,408.8 $6,521.9 113.1 1.8% Total Outstanding $3,144.9 $3,151.4 6.5 0.2% Total Borrowers (#) 6,589 6,699 110 1.7% Total Facilities (#) 11,042 11,188 146 1.3% SM and Classified Commitments $572.2 $595.8 23.6 4.1% SM Commitments $176.6 $161.8 (14.8) -8.4% Classified Commitments $395.6 $434.0 38.4 9.7% Nonaccrual Commitments $50.4 $65.1 14.7 29.1% Note: Figures may not add to totals due to rounding. 2024 vs. 2023 (%) 2024 vs. 2023 ($Billions) 2024 Commitments ($Billions) 2023 Commitments ($Billions) Total Unfunded Total Outstanding Total Number of Facilities (Line)

- 5 - Exhibit 3 shows trends in the dollar volume of special mention plus classified commitments as a percentage of total commitments. The dollar volume and percentage of s pecial mention plus classified commitment s increased modestly in 202 4 . S p ecial mention plus classified commitments now represent 9 .1 percent of total commitments , with a classified rate of 6. 6 percent and a special mention rate of 2. 5 percent. Total classified commitments increased $38.4 billion from 2023, while special mention decreased by $14.8 billion over the same time frame. Exhibit 3: Overall Special Mention Plus Classified Volume and Percentage Trends Leveraged Lending Agent b ank - identified leverag ed loan s represent 4 5 percent of total SNC commitments , 79 percent of special mention com mitments, and 8 4 percent of classified commitments. Total agent ba nk - identified leveraged loan commitments grew modestly by $ 10 . 5 billion between 202 3 and 202 4 . Newly originated a gent b ank - identified leveraged lending remains a primary focus of SNC review samples given the volume , asset quality, and layered underwriting risk within the segment. T he 202 4 SNC s ample covered 3 4 percent of agent bank - identified leveraged lending commitments and 28 percent of agent bank - identified leveraged borrowers (see exhibit 4).

- 6 - B a nks hold $ 1. 9 trillion or 6 3 percent of agent bank - identified leveraged term loans and revolvers , most of which consists of higher rated and investment grade equivalent revolvers. Nonbanks primarily hold non - investment grade equivalent term loans (see exhibit 5). Exhibit 5 : Agent Bank Identified Leveraged Lending by Ownership, Credit Type and Quality 202 4 Focus Industries The agencies focused on the Commercial Services; Health C are and Pharmaceuticals; Materials and Commodities; Real Estate and Construction; and Technology, Telecom and Media industr y segments in 202 4 . These industries showed high and/or increasing special mention and classified rates. The agencies targeted sub - groups within these industries that had greater vulnerability to idiosyncratic and other macroeconomic factors. Ex hibit 6 illustrates trends in the level of special mention and classified as a percentage of total commitments within the f ive focus ed industr y segments . Technology, Telecom, and Media remains the highest special mention and classified rate at 19.7 percent, followed by Commercial Services at 17.4 percent , Health Care and Pharmaceuticals at 14.4 percent , and Materials and Commodities excluding Oil and Gas industry segments at 12.4 percent . As reflected in E xhibit 7, r isk in Commercial Real Estate varies by sub - sector , with special mention and classified commitments increasing in O ffice , H otel and L odging , and multi - family and healthcare within the All Other category and a decreas e in Retail . E xhibit 7 illustrates that banks own a higher percentage of non - pass commitments , while t he current non - pass rate for Commercial Real Estate has increased to 8.2 percent as reflected in Exhibit 6 . 2024 SNC 2024 SNC Bank Owned ($Billions) Nonbank Owned ($Billions) Investment Grade - Revolver $862.6 $19.1 Investment Grade - Term Loan $186.3 $38.4 Non-Investment Grade - Revolver $561.9 $27.0 Non-Investment Grade - Term Loan $242.6 $994.3 Total $1,853.4 $1,078.8 Note: Figures may not add to totals due to rounding.

- 8 - SNC Commitments: Ownership of Risk U.S. B anks continue to hold the largest amount of SNC commitments, followed by F oreign B ank ing O rganizations (F BOs) and N onbanks (see exhibit 8 ). Nonbanks continue to hold a disproportionate share of all loan commitments rated special mention and classified (see exhibit 9) ; however, the level held by banks increased during 2024 . U.S. B anks and FBOs held 7 9 . 7 percent of the total exposure , which is relatively unchanged from 2023. During the same time frame, U.S. Banks’ and FBOs’ percent of the non - pass exposure increased from 35.0 to 40.4 percent . The special mention and classified rates at U.S. B anks and FBOs are 4 . 7 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively, while the special mention and classified rate at N onbanks is 26.8 percent.

- 9 - Appendix A: Definitions Agent Bank: A gent Bank is defined as a federally supervised institution that originate s or administer s a SNC for the syndication or participating lenders. Classified C ommitments : Classified commitments include commitments rated substandard, doubtful, and loss as defined below . Credit F acilities : Credit facilities include syndicated loans and loan commitments, letters of credit, commercial leases, a nd other forms of credit. Commitment amounts include both drawn and undrawn portions of the loans or credit facilities. The SNC review reports only the par amounts of commitments, which may differ from the amounts at which loans are carried by investors. Doubtful: Doubtful commitments have all the weaknesses of commitments classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of available current information, highly questionable and improbable. Loss: Commitments classified as loss are uncollectible and of so little value that their continuance as bankable commitments is not warranted. Amounts classified as loss should be promptly charged off. This classification does not mean that there is no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off these commitments, even though some value may be recovered in the future. Nonaccrual: Nonaccrual loans are defined for regulatory reporting purposes as loans and lease financing receivables that are required to be reported on a nonaccrual basis because (a) they are maintained on a cash basis owing to a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower, (b) payment in full of interest or principal is not expected, or (c) principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or longer, unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection. Non - pass : A non - pass loan is any loan rated special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss. Pass: A credit facility that is in good standing and is not rated special mention or classified in any way. Shared N ational C redit (SNC): A SNC is any loan or formal commitment, and any asset such as real estate, stocks, notes, bonds, and debentures taken as debts previously contracted, extended to borrowers by a federally supervised institution, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, that aggregates to $100 million or more and is shared by three or more unaffiliated federally supervised institutions, or a portion of which is sold to two or more such institutions. Special M ention (SM) : Special mention commitments have potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses could result in further deterioration of the repayment prospects or in the institution's credit position in the future. Special mention commitments are not adversely classified and do not expose in stitutions to sufficient risk to warrant adverse rating. Substandard: Substandard commitments are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard commitments have well - defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and present the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected.
